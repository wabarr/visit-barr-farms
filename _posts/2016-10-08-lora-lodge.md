We build Lora Lodge using reclaimed materials from the old farm house that stood just a few feet away. The stone was collected from hand dug wells in the area that we collected over several years.  Many of the timbers in the construction came from the large barn.  This house provides all the modern conveniences you would expect, created with a respect for our history.
